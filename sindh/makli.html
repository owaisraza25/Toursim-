        Makli Necropolis is one of the largest funerary sites in the world, spread
         over an area of 10 kilometres near the city of Thatta, in the Pakistani province
          of Sindh. The site houses approximately 500,000 to 1 million tombs built over the
           course of a 400-year period. Makli Necropolis features several large funerary
            monuments belonging to royalty, various Sufi saints, and esteemed scholars.
             The site was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981 as an "outstanding 
             testament" to Sindhi civilization between the 14th and 18th centuries.</p> </blockquote>
