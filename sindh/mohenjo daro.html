      Mohenjo-daro is an archaeological site in the province of Sindh, Pakistan. Built 
      around 2500 BCE, it was the largest settlement of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation,
       and one of the world's earliest major cities, contemporaneous with the civilizations 
       of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Minoan Crete, and Norte Chico. With an estimated population 
       of at least 40,000 people, Mohenjo-daro prospered until around 1700 BCE. Mohenjo-daro was
        abandoned in the 19th century BCE as the Indus Valley Civilization declined, and the site was not rediscovered
         until the 1920s. Significant excavation has since been conducted at the site of the city, which was designated 
         a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980, the first site in South Asia to be so designated.
       The site is currently threatened by<br />
        erosion and improper restoration.</p> </blockquote>
