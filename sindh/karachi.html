    Karachi,The remarkable skyline is but one of the wonderful attractions of the city,
     and this grand South Asian city holds many surprises for anyone who decides to seek them out. 
     Karachi is home to over 15 million inhabitants (2017, although some estimate it it to be 18 million 
     because of undercounting), from all over the country and even abroad, and is a vibrant melting
      pot of cultures and ideas. Visitors will be met with a new and exciting experience around 
      each corner, and on every visit. The city is known as the "City of the Quaid" because the 
      founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, was born, raised and spent his last years here. Additionally due to its 
      round-the-clock liveliness, Karachi is now more popularly and affectionately referred to as the "City of Lights".<br />

The most diverse and cosmopolitan city of Pakistan, Karachi lives and breathes with a style of its own. The most advanced
 city of the nation, it often blazes forward as an example of the Pakistan to come,
  and because of its diverse makeÂ­up, is sometimes described as a mini-Pakistan, where you can find representatives of 
  every Pakistani culture. Karachi is the third most populous city in the world, and the largest among the Muslim world. 
  Because of this and its melting pot nature, the pace of life is faster and the social attitudes more liberal than elsewhere 
  in the nation, and growth rate of the city makes it an evolving hub where people from different backgrounds meet and shape the 
  future of the city and of Pakistan.</p> </blockquote>
